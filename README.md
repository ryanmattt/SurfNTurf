## Running
This game was developed primarily on Ubuntu using GameMaker Beta and as such it is not recommended to load the game into Game Maker itself.

You can find the most up to date release on the [releases page](https://github.com/ryanmattt/SurfNTurf/releases)

## Game Description
The Genre of the game is Dating Sim and as such we'd recommend players are 16+. It can be played in under 10 minutes and there is a rich dialogue and karma system. WASD to move arrow keys for dialogue, Escape for pause, and a mix between Space/Enter for other things (the controls are not consistent).

It's your 18th birthday and there's a mysterious vibe in the air. Your father has been awfully cagey these past few days and you have a strong suspiscion something is about to go down. He has a present he's been waiting to give you...

(Uh when you get on the surfboad you need to surf down, but the game doesn't tell you that)
