/*
Ross: Mom, you're crazy. Someone needs to stop you. I need to stop you.
Ursiline: How are you going to do that?
Ross: Your powers are in the necklace, right? I can do something with that!
Ursiline: I'd like to see you try.
Ross: See, mother, you're neglecting to acknowledge that I am the dopest surfer on Tenderloin Beach and underestimate my radical abilities. 
Ursiline: You're ridiculous and weak, and you don't have the stomach to destroy your sweet mother. 
Ross: I'm sick of you, mom! You're horrible, pathetic, and a true sea bitch. I will never let you rule the ocean again
Ursiline: Yeah? What are you gonna do?
Ross: I'm gonna use this necklace. I've felt so powerful since I've gotten it. I can destroy you. Forever
Ursiline: Go ahead.
Ross: I will use the necklace to kill you. RIGHT HERE! RIGHT NOW!
Ursiline: Oh Ross, you sound just like me…and I like to hear it.
